C++ is not pure object oriented programming language because a C++ programme can be written without use of any classes.

However....

Java is a pure object oriented programming language because a java programme can not be written without use of classes.

==========================
Polymorphism-----------> Overloading & Binding

Overloading --->Function Overloading & Operator Overloading

Binding---->Static binding & Dynamic Binding

==========================
In C , functions are not allowed inside structures.
In C++, functions are allowed inside structures.

But in both C and C++ structures , the data members are easily accessible by anyone throughout  the program.

Classes introduced data hiding in C++.

Object is a variable of type (some)class.

C++ Structure members are private , public and protected.
But by default members are public.
Also structures cannot be inherrited , classes can be inherrited.
