This is a collection of basic c/c++ programmes.Some of them are tricky and provide with more than just basic concepts.
I found most of them on the internet and in various books.
These were helpful to me in the process of learning basics of the language. I hope they are helpful for anyone who studies them.
Topics Covered:
*Sorting
*Structures
*Unions
*If-else
*Arrays
*Strings
*Pointers
*Undefined behaviour  etc...
